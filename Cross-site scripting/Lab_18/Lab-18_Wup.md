# Target Goal: 

This lab contains a reflected cross-site scripting vulnerability in the search query tracking functionality. The reflection occurs inside a JavaScript string with single quotes and backslashes escaped.

To solve this lab, perform a cross-site scripting attack that breaks out of the JavaScript string and calls the alert function.
