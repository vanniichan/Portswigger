# Target Goal: 

This lab uses AngularJS in an unusual way where the $eval function is not available and you will be unable to use any strings in AngularJS.

To solve the lab, perform a cross-site scripting attack that escapes the sandbox and executes the alert function without using the $eval function.

# Recon:
